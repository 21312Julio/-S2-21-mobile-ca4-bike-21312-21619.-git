## Overview (Full Document Uploaded on Moodle)

The purpose of this document is to report the process behind the creating of this application for the mobile development class assignment.
I plan on going through mockups, references, challenges and code implemented. Through this module I was able to better understand how android 
apps are created in a combination of visual design and coding, as well as how APIs work when integrated into the project.
